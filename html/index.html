        <div id="content1"><p>Pararsite is about a poor family living in very poor conditions. While they have jobs they will perform minor scams to get by. The son, Ki-Woo dreams of getting out of poverty by going to university one day. Despite not having university education, Ki-Woo's friend Min asks him to take over his tutoring job for Park Da-Hye. The Park's are a wealthy family who lives in a modernistic house designed by the former residence of a famed architect Namgoong. Min reassures Ki-Woo to feel comfortable about lying to Mrs. Park about his education to get a job. Ki-Woo eventually learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for their adolescent son and Ki-Woo quickly recommends his art therapist friend "Jessica", which is actually his sister. The Kims decide to pull off a scam for all the Kims to replace existing servants. The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-Gwang, who was Namgoong's housekeeper when he lived there, meaning that she knows all the nooks and crannies of the house. How far can the Kims take their scam in becoming their own version of the Parks.</p></div>
